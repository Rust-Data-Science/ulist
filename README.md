### What
Ulist is an ultra fast list/array data structure written in Rust with Python bindings. It aims to be the fundamental package for processing and computing 1-D list/array in Python.   
It provides:  

* an efficient, flexible and expressive 1-D list/array object;  
* broadcasting methods;  
* a SQL-like and method-chaining programming experience;  


### Performance
Ulist is extremly fast, and even compared with libraries like Numpy. It is  
* more efficient on the `string` and `boolean` array,  
* same level efficient on the `integer` array,  
* and a bit slower on the `floating` array.  

Faster than Numpy is not the target of writing this repo, because they are just two different libraries. Ulist is more focused on general domain rather than just data science/machine learning/AI, for example the Linear Algebra Computation is not provided. But if you are curious about the performance, please see the [benchmarking results](https://github.com/tushushu/ulist/blob/main/benchmark.md).


### Requirements
* Python: 3.7+    
* OS: Linux, MacOS and Windows


### Installation
Run `pip install ulist`


### Examples

#### Count the number of items in bins.
Given an array `arr`, count the number of items in bins [0, 3), [3, 6), [6, 9) and [9, +inf). The `result` is a Python dictionary with bin names as keys and numbers as values. 
```Python
>>> import ulist as ul

>>> arr = ul.arange(12)
>>> arr
UltraFastList([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11])

>>> result = arr.case(default='[9, +inf)')\
...             .when(lambda x: x < 3, then='[0, 3)')\
...             .when(lambda x: x < 6, then='[3, 6)')\
...             .when(lambda x: x < 9, then='[6, 9)')\
...             .end()\
...             .counter()
>>> result
{'[3, 6)': 3, '[9, +inf)': 3, '[6, 9)': 3, '[0, 3)': 3}
```


#### Dot product.
Given two 1-D arrays and calculate the dot product result of those arrays.
```Python
>>> import ulist as ul

>>> arr = ul.from_seq(range(1, 4), dtype='float')
>>> arr
UltraFastList([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

>>> result = arr.mul(arr).sum()
>>> result
14.0
```

#### Rate of adults.
Given the ages of people as `arr`, and suppose the adults are equal or above 18. Clean the data by removing abnormal values and then calculate the rate of adults.
```Python
>>> import ulist as ul

>>> arr = ul.from_seq([-1, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 100, 200], dtype='int')
>>> result = arr.where(lambda x: (x >= 0) & (x < 120))\
...             .apply(lambda x: x >= 18)\
...             .mean()
>>> result
0.75
```
