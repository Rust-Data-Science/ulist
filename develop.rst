Develop
=======

Python Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``ulist`` is built and published by ``maturin``, so make sure you have ``maturin`` installed before developing anything;
-  ``pytest`` and ``pytest-cov`` is the testing framework for ``ulist``, we aim to 100% test coverage;
-  ``Flake8`` and ``mypy`` are the linters for ``ulist``, they help us to check the code style, bugs and type annotation;
-  ``sphinx`` auto-generates API documentation for ``ulist``.

Build
~~~~~

-  Run ``maturin develop`` to build the crate and install it as a python module directly in the current virtualenv. Note that while maturin develop is faster, it doesnâ€™t support all the features that running pip install after ``maturin build`` supports.
-  Run ``maturin build`` to build the wheels and store them in a folder (target/wheels by default).
-  Run ``maturin build --release`` If we want to benchmark the package.

Test
~~~~~

-  Run ``cd tests && sh run.sh`` to test your branch locally.

Docker
~~~~~~

The docker images before version 0.5.0 are saved in https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tushushu/ulist

- Build by docker, please run ``docker run -it -i <image ID>``, and then run ``maturin build``.
- Customize the build, please consider to change the arguments ``gh_username``, ``ulist_home`` and ``branch`` in the ``Dockerfile`` before building.
- run ``docker cp <containerId>:/home/ulist/ulist/target/wheels /host/path/target`` to copy the wheel for Linux to local disk.
